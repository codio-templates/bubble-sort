# Instructions
This assignment explains the concept of the well known bubble sort algorithm. The following pages contain the theoretical overview.

# Creating your code
Once you are familiar with the theory, you should create a java class that implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. Please follow these steps carefully when carrying out this assignment.

- Create a class called `Bubble` in the main workspace folder
- Your class should expect an array of unsorted numbers to be passed in as a command line argument.
- Your code should sort this array and output the result.
- One you have completed the assignment you should mark the assignment as complete from your Codio classroom.

# Grading
This assignment will be graded in 2 ways

- **Automated test** : this will pass in a random array of unsorted numbers and examine the output for correctness. You should run this test yourself in before you submit the assignment. The test can be run on the last page of this document.
- **Manual grading** : a lecturer will manually assess your code and assign a final grade.

Please be aware that the lecturer will be checking for instances of plagiarism.
